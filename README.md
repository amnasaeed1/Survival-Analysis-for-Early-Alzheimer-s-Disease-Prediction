# Survival-Analysis-for-Early-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction

This repository contains the code for the proeject which focuses on using survival analysis for the early prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). 

Survival analysis is a statistical approach used to predict the time until an event of interest occurs, such as disease onset or progression. In the context of this project, the 'event' is the conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's Disease.

The project uses machine learning techniques, Random Survival Forest, Extra Survival Trees, Coxnet, CoxPH, Gradient Boosting Survival, Survival Tree; to estimate the risk of conversion over time. These model generate individualized survival curves for each patient, allowing for a more personalized prediction of when the conversion from MCI to AD is likely to occur. The ultimate goal is to aid in clinical decision-making by identifying high-risk patients at an earlier stage, potentially leading to more timely interventions.
